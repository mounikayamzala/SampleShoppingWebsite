                    Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating
                    (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, eating and/or working with an
                    item, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient
                    height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store
                    things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can be a product of design and can be
                    considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a
                    symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal,
                    plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflects
                    the local culture.

                Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating
                (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, eating and/or working with an
                item, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient
                height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store
                things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can be a product of design and can be
                considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a
                symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal,
                plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflects
                the local culture. Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities
